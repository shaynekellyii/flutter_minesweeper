# Flutter Minesweeper

Minesweeper built using Flutter Web, ready to run on a web browser. The app can also be built for Android/iOS, and Mac/Windows/Linux. 

Features include:
* A responsive layout for desktop and mobile
* Beginner, intermediate, expert, and custom difficulties
* Material Design with Light and Dark modes
* High scores saved during the current session

Deployed on Heroku using an NGINX server + Docker.

## Disclaimer

Straight from Google:

> Warning: As of 1.9, web support is available as a tech preview. As web support hasnâ€™t yet reached alpha, you can expect to experience crashes and missing features.

It seems to be working fairly well though, minus some bugs in the dartlang compiler that I encountered and other build issues.

## Architecture

The state management solution used in this app is Provider + ChangeNotifier. [This solution is suggested as the pragmatic state management solution by Google.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I) It's an easy and lightweight way to rebuild widgets only when state changes and have your UI respond to state changes reactively.

## Deployment

There's not much documentation on how to deploy a webapp built with Flutter since the web framework is still pre-alpha.

When you generate a Flutter web release build, you end up with a static site under `build/web`. The easiest way for me to deploy to Heroku was to create a Docker container which copies the static web files over and starts an NGINX server.

See the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/shaynekellyii/flutter_minesweeper/blob/master/Dockerfile) and the [basic build script](https://github.com/shaynekellyii/flutter_minesweeper/blob/master/push_to_heroku.sh) for more details.

## Tests

The project includes basic widget tests and unit tests.
